My First Android application: Tasbih!

The application name is "Tasbih", and the application is basically an Islamic rosary (sibha) you could use to do tasbih after you pray.

Note: The application supports Material You's monet theme engine, i.e., its color will be dynamic depending on your wallpaper.

Disclaimer: Material You's monet theme engine is supported by Android 12+ (12, 12L, 13, and 14) only. If you tried to use it on Android 11 and lower, the application would be in blue only.
